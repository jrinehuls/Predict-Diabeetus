Data was collected from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/houcembenmansour/predict-diabetes-based-on-diagnostic-measures

You will need the diabetes.csv, which is in the repository.

Detects whether a patient has diabeetus. Also predicts likelihood of having diabeetus. A KNeighborsClassifier model is trained on data for patients who were confirmed to have or not have diabeetus as well as many risk factors, such as glucose levels, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, weight, age, and blood pressure. The model's hyperparameters are tuned for optimal accuracy and precision using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV. Once the model is tuned, it makes preditions on whether new patients have diabeetus or not.
